# NFTSalesv2
Second version of my discord bot for NFT sales

The main idea of this bot is to use as less as possible the openSea API because the API is ewww if you don't have a private key.
And i'm pretty sure a lot of project don't have a private key.

## How to launch it

You need to have an RPC adress, infura is great and the first 100 000 request/day are free.
After that you only need to retrieve the `abi.json` that you can find on etherscan.
Then you have to create a `config.json` at the root of the repos.

And the last things to do is to install the different dependencies with `npm i` !
