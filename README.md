# NFTSalesv2
Second version of my discord bot for NFT sales

The main idea of this bot is to use as less as possible the openSea API because the API is ewww if you don't have a private key.
And i'm pretty sure a lot of project don't have a private key.

## How to launch it

To run the bot locally you have to create an `abi` folder that will contain the `abi.json` of the contract of your choise.
It also needs a `config.json` at the root of the repos. Just look after the exemple to understand what you have to add in the .json it's pretty self explanatory.
